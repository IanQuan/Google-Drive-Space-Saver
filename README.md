# Google-Drive-Space-Saver

## Introduction
Google Drive Space Saver is a hackathon project aimed at helping users optimize their Google Drive storage by identifying and recommending files that have not been used or updated for a long time. With this tool, users can easily review these files, decide whether to delete them to free up space, or keep them for archival purposes.

## Features
**File Usage Analysis:** The application scans your Google Drive to identify files that haven't been accessed or modified in a long time.

**Recommendations:** It provides a list of these files along with recommendations to either delete or keep them, helping you make informed decisions.

**Secure Authentication:** The application uses Google's OAuth authentication, ensuring that your Google Drive data is safe and secure.

**User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and intuitive user interface makes it easy for users of all levels to navigate and manage their Google Drive storage.

Happy space-saving on Google Drive! ðŸ˜„ðŸš€
